\subsection{AD-00-05: Full Stream Alert Distribution}
\label{ad-00-05}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

DMS-REQ-0002

\subsubsection{Test items}
\label{ad-00-05-items}

This test will check that the full stream of LSST alerts can be distributed to end users.

Specifically, this will demonstrate that:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Serialized alert packets can be loaded into the alert distribution system at LSST-relevant scales;}
  \item{Alert packets can be retrieved from the queue system at LSST-relevant scales.}

\end{itemize}

This test does not include quantitative targets for latency.

\subsubsection{Intercase dependencies}

\begin{itemize}

  \item{\hyperref[ad-00-00]{AD-00-00}}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Environmental needs}

\paragraph{Hardware}

The test shall be carried out on a machine with at least 16\,GB of RAM and
multiple CPU cores which has access to the \texttt{/datasets} shared (GPFS)
filesystem at the LSST Data Facility.

\paragraph{Software}

The Kafka cluster and Zookeeper shall be instantiated according to the 
procedure described in \hyperref[ad-00-00]{AD-00-00}).

\subsubsection{Input specification}

A sample of Avro-formatted alert packets derived from 

This dataset shall be made available \textit{how?  directory of alerts on datasets?}

\subsubsection{Output specification}

None.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

\begin{itemize}

  \item{instructions for loading packets into running Kafka system}

  \item{instructions for retrieving packets}

  \item{instructions for monitoring what is retreived}

\end{itemize}
